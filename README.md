# r-tutorial

This is the first part of R tutorials that I used with students for the discussion sessions of the Applied Econometrics (AAE636) class at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am working with a colleague (Bethany Glinsmann) to re-edit them for the incoming students who are new to R programming. We hope that students can use this material to get ready before the class starts, so that they can focus on the econometrics, rather than trying to grapple with learning how to program. The tutorials could be paired with training on DataCamp.

Our loose outline is:

0.       How to download & install R, RStudio, and add-ons for RMarkdown
1.       R operators, data structures, importing data, working with RMarkdown
2.       Dataframes, subsetting & cleaning data, intro to tidyverse functions, writing your own function
3.       Graphing with ggplot2
